#What is the purpose continue statement in python?
'''
the continue statement in python is used to skip the rest of code inside a loop
for the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.


for example ,
for i in range(5):
    if i==2:
        continue
    print(i)

in the above code loopn run  o to 4 but when i is equal to 2 the continue
statement is executed, this means loop to skip the print(i) for i==2.
so nuber is print 0,1,3,4.
